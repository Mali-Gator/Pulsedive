This repository contains scripts which can be used to query data from Pulsedive data.

Use these scripts at your own risk. I don't have time to review/revise/edit them so please don't ask. However, if you have any feedback feel free to send along or if you'd like me to post a rule that you have created, please don't hesitate to reach out.

AGAIN, EVERTHING IN HERE IS USE-AT-YOUR-OWN-RISK.
